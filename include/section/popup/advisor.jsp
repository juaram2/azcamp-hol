                        <p class="desc">Jun Ho Lee has become the CEO of JIENUM a platform that provides lodge-booking services for travellers
                            while he was majoring Economics at Northwestern University. Jun Ho felt that there were a lot
                            of apps for booking hotel rooms, but younger tourists still were not well-informed about various
                            unique lodging options such as guest houses. He wanted to create a platform to introduce many
                            suitable choices for travellers. Based on more than 1,000 guest home vacation spots in South
                            Korea, Jienem is introducing all of its businesses such as MonStay, EGStay guesthouse franchise,
                            business establishment education, and consignment operations. Among the Korean O2O (online to
                            offline) guesthouses, the only place where the online reservation service and the offline guest
                            house are operated together is Jienem. A giant accommodation reservtation service operator Yanolja
                            made a strategic investment in Jienem company. Jienem also attracted investments from Capston
                            Partners for free series A which is worth $500 million (500 million KRW). This investment is
                            meaningful because VC's investment in startup companies is highly valued and driven by its future
                            growth. Jun Ho was a part of Gookmin University’s entrepreneurship group’s idea that got selected
                            as a part of Korea’s sponsored accelerated program. He has been able to get funding from Angel
