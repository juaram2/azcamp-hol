                    <b>Q</b>What is a cryptocurrency?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>A cryptocurrency uses cryptography for security and is a digital / virtual currency. It is truly difficult
                        to invade cryptocurrency because of the security feature. A cryptocurrency is not issued by any central
                        authority which is its organic nature, which makes it theoretically immune to government interference
                        or manipulation from other source.</p>
